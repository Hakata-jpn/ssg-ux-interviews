## Tell me about MagicBox, and what your interactions with the Murphy's Magic Site?

A lot of preordering, comes with a few pain points. Uses RealCommerce, connected to Murphy's. They have to manually add products every time they do a presale since it's not listed on their site when the product comes with zero stock. Both retail and online, and a mini theater built into the shop. 80% of sales is based online. Usually customer demand tends to lead him to buy several extra copies. Presales can be a little precarious since they can be a risky buy. Tries to find something that isn't presale to push so that they're a unique seller of that product.

Generally speaking, always open on the website but mostly just checking on items physically as the orders come 5-6 times a day.

## How do you keep yourself updated with the latest products?

Generally uses reviews (Craig Petty and Magic Orthodoxy) and customer feedback, depends on our emails to stay in our loop with the company.

## How proficient with technology are you?

Tech savvy enough to run the website by himself.

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic?

Uses eBay and Amazon. Both are pretty confusing, likes the simplicity of Murphy's. Find the search to be difficult, uses the same search criteria on his site and it could be improved. (Suggestion: Pinned posts for common search items like bicycle cards?)

## What features are you using on the website that don't involve directly purchasing goods?

Often uses the instructions section for products already purchased, doesn't really use anything else.

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the accounts page?

Doesn't really use it outside of instructions and paying for invoices. Invoices don't list what the downloads are unless you're in the downloads panel, had some issues with fraud through buying downloads where he couldn't find it due to the downloads being listed in another portal.

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website? 

Presale wording is really strange. Are we selling today? Is it when it's released?
Would love to see a window for upcoming presales, has to dig through their emails to determine what's coming up. **IMPORTANT**
Would prefer it if we had families work on the same page, instead of splitting related products on the same page. Uses workarounds to not fill up their home page with duplicates.
Would love to see old invoices in the same page as the current invoices for the month
**Downloads get instantly charged on their account, they can't get it refunded from us even if the downloaded goods were not used at all and the card was canceled. Loss of control due to the digital nature of the good. (No fraud protection on our end??)**
