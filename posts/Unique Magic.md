## Tell me about Unique Magic, and what your interactions with the Murphy's Magic Site?

Was a dealer 20 years ago, recently got back into the business in 2021. Used to talk to kids about disabilities in schools, now going back into magic shows for kids, pushing that people can be magicians even with disabilities. Post-show sales turned into businesses and selling products to everyone. Shows feed the shop, pros now come to him for sales. Looking to grow sales, gets lots of web traffic at the moment. Not aware of web services, would benefit greatly from it.

Uses a script with Python that gathers download updates from the store and social media, and runs it several times a day. Very rarely goes to our site, mostly just to place orders. Really uses the videos from Youtube, trying to find a way to automate getting those videos on his site.

*Tl;DR: Has prior dealer experience but has exploded due to our input, he really attributes his success to us.*

## How proficient with technology are you?

Does software development in his spare time, used to be a C++ and Java dev back in the day. Incredibly proficient, the most so far.

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic?

One of the best wholesale sites he's seen, probably 2nd out of 10. The experience is probably one of the best out of any of the others he's shopped with. Clean, simple, does what he needs to. Would be nice if there was a webapp/mobile site.

## What features are you using on the website that don't involve directly purchasing goods?

Tries to automate everything to the point where he's never on the site, check the answer below.

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the accounts page?

Accesses recent orders quite frequently, not really concerned with anything other than placing orders and leaving. Would love to find an automatic center.

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website? 
Some products will not show up when he searches a product key unless he's logged in, not sure why.
Downloads have to be purchased separately from physical goods, that's about the only
Billing would be nicer if they were charged to the dealer when the physical goods in the same invoice on the same day.
Wants to be able to drop ship orders, adds the shop name in the mailing information automatically as if the drop ship is being mailed to his business, but he wants to put it in manually so that they can list the name of the person they want to ship to instead. Otherwise, he has to manually have sales fix it every time he drop ships.
