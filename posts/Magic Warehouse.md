## Tell me about Magic Warehouse, and what your interactions with the Murphy's Magic Site?

Would like to be more integrated in to the site. Uses a generated CSV from their site uploaded onto their site. Looks at new items every day, some automation through webservices to pull product information, but still adds each item in individually. Does curate products, but only needs PRODUCT ID and the name of the item.

Started in 1996, has been his own IT guy ever since.

## How proficient with technology are you?

Reasonably proficient, coded his website back in the day with Perl

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic?

Finds us to be unique to his integration to our site, orders manually from the alternatives. Works pretty good, would be a different story if you did it manually on Murphy's. Not sure how anyone would go about that, it'd be crazy to work without it. It's too slow the old fashioned way.

The site is pretty slow though, it can take some time to perform operations. It's not instant.

## What features are you using on the website that don't involve directly purchasing goods?

Updates product quantities from time to time using Web Services, doing small bits at a time. Retrieves video downloads from us, and for non-streaming content he downloads things manually. Sometimes uses translations, sometimes checks downloads portal to see if there's any issues. Payments are done on our end, it just gets charged to credit cards.

Defective item requests happen from time to time.

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website? 
Wishes there was more catering.
Because he doesn't have web services, he can't reserve items... This is especially an issue during flash sales
Has to complete orders, might be missing something, ask sales?
Downloads a PO report every day? Would love a sheet that's just product ID's and the names of the product.
Feels like the new model of not holding inventory is being exploited.
Feels like the future of magic is riddled with issues (knock offs, Amazon, aggressive pricing schemes)
Sometimes he loses records on item purchases, would like to see if products would tell you the last time an item was purchased.
