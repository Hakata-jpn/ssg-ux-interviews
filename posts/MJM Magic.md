 *NOTE: This interview was performed via email due to Jeff's busy schedule. Questions were adjusted accordingly to account for my inability to adjust questions during the interview as you might in a live interview.*

## What parts of your business do you operate manually through the Murphy’s site? What parts of your business have you automated with web services?
__Jeff:__ *Manually, I use the Admin Area to pay our daily invoices, check the items in our Open Order, and get the UPS tracking number for Closed Orders. I also use the website to view the instructional videos for products to help know about the product(s) we are selling. Everything else is basically automated through web services. All products and inventory are updated through web services, and orders are compiled and submitted via web services*

## How proficient with technology are you?

__Jeff:__ *I am above average.  I used to be a Software Engineer about a decade ago, and I'm the main guy who implements and runs the entire MJM Magic website. All interfacing with web services was done by myself.*

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic?

__Jeff:__ *No complaints here.  I don't "shop" at Murphy's so I don't think of it the same way as other retailers. All my orders with Murphy's are automated. I don't have to shop for anything, since I mainly order what our customers ask us for, or to stock up on preorders which I feel will be good sellers.*

## On a scale from 1-10 (with 10 as a perfect score), how would you rate the experience of using the Murphy's Magic website and why?

__Jeff:__ *I would say an 8.  I dock one point because nothing is perfect.......and I dock another because occasionally, your website has TIMEOUT / Connection issues where we cannot view our open orders. Here is an example that happened just the other day:*

- Following the trend of a lot of dealers, they really depend on the API to get everything to work on their end. A lot of the design decisions we make is are a matter of making the other administrative tasks they do as seamless and easy to find as possible.

## What features are you using on the website that don't involve directly purchasing goods?

__Jeff:__ *See my answer to the first question (above.)*

## What are your inital impressions of our home page?

__Jeff:__ *Looks good but honestly, it doesn't pertain to me.  I never look at the homepage except maybe to grab an image to use as a product banner for our own website.  As a dealer, my only interest is in my Admin Area where I can pay bills, see open / closed orders, and look up Product Instructional videos.   The home page (in my opinion) is for new dealers or customers who you're trying to reach, not for long time O.G.'s like myself.  :)*

## What are your initial impressions when you look at the accounts page?

__Jeff:__ *It's easy enough for me to navigate, but there's a lot of information there that I simply don't use need.   For example, I hardly never look at any of those options under Reports ("Top Products Purchased", "Monthly Order Statistics", etc), nor do I ever look at the items under Business Tools ("Reorder Top 50 Purchased", "Discounted Items", etc.)   I do, whoever, look at the Purchase Ranking, and how much I need to purchase to move up to the next rank.*

*Now, to add to that above, those things I "never" look at doesn't mean that I won't.  It's just not a priority or a daily thing for me because I have most of my stuff automated regarding adding products and compiling orders (which are my two daily priorities).   For example, if I am looking to run some kind of special promotion, I may click on your "Best Profit Margin Products" link under Business Tools to find some kind of product to give away.......but I might do that once or twice a year.  Not something I do often.*

- The Business tools list is pretty underutilized, even for people who've been using the site for years. We should either update the list so it's more helpful or remove it entirely. (I favor removal, since it adds so much clutter)
- Being able to progressively disclose some of the less utilized windows in the "My Account" pages seems to be as though it'd be most helpful for dealers overall.

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of the Murphy’s Magic website?

__Jeff:__ *Maybe have all your product pages point to MJM Magic to purchase the items!  :)  Seriously, if I think of anything, I can let you know.....but drawing a blank right now.*
