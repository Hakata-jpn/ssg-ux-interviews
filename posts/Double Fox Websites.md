## Tell me about Quality Magic, and what your interactions with the Murphy's Magic Site?

Less to do with the Murphy's site itself and more with the API. Doesn't know what their experiences are like on the site itself:

When they're logged in and on their account: 
 - They don't know that they can resend the download email if it fails to send the first time.
 - Because the downloads are purchased on a different site, then they have to access ours, it makes things very confusing for customers who purchase downloads on one store and have to access it on another.

Some dealers express concerns with product information changes, and then dealers have to manually change things for their site.

Some of the tags for data should be merged and simplified since data is currently organized in a manner that makes it hard for users to sort. (Ex: 7 Magic and 7 Magic_tricks)

## How proficient with technology are your clients?

Most of them are not technical, and come to Double Fox because they hate dealing with the constant updates for the site. They are magicians first, tech comes secondary.

Because the download system was so confusing, it lost them a dealer as a client.

## You said you send emails out to clients, what kinds do you send?

Flash sale emails, with warnings about participation dates. Discusses the implementation of new features with dealers. Notifies people with any issues, site outages, and so forth. 

General announcements for the most part.

## In your experience, how dealers get their information? If you do, how?

They run a pretty tight ship where everything automated on their end. Discontinued products come in from time to time without them knowing. Dealers can request for items that might be missing from the Murphy's website, and will make sure the product is in everyone's database within their network if found.

When the request is made, Lori and ____ will check to see if the product is extant.

## What issues do Dealers experience with onboarding?

It's super simple for dealers since they handle everything else. Setting up their payment system is part of their job description as well.

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website? 

Would be nice if flash sale information arrived to the devs before the flash sale information, since they support the flash sales in the back end.

Will the next revision of the site be mobile friendly. An improvement for showing customers how to access downloads by dealers.
