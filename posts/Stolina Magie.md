## Tell me about Stolina Magie, and what your interactions with the Murphy's Magic Site?

Sells primarily to hobbyist magicians and some professionals but the main focus is the former. Very important to get the latest stuff in magic. Customers are very insistent on knowing what's new. Only uses website for orders and tutorials, uses webservices for completing orders. Downloads are being improved and they like it, downloads are becoming more important for their business.

## How proficient with technology are you?

Very proficient with using computers, Robert (the owner) isn't. Only uses our service, doesn't use SMS (? wasn't sure exactly what that was, lost in translation)

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic?

Yes, it's getting more and more important to shop online. A lot of items aren't available in store anymore. Nice to have a quick view of what's in stock at Murphy's. Doesn't feel like other websites in Magic are as good, besides Difatta. It's faster than Murphy's, but the products in stock @ Murphy's are better than Difatta. Says we're significantly better than Ellusionist.

Amazon's search does autocomplete (search needs to be exact to work), works faster. We have the same problem at Stolina. Could be a place to improve.

## On a scale from 1-10 (with 10 as a perfect score), how would you rate the experience of using the Murphy's Magic website and why?

**6**

**Good:** Item selections, very good overview of new stuff coming in. Product explanations are good, downloads are good. "Modern" site. Lots of functions that he could use but neither he nor Robert uses them. 

**Bad:** Searching navigation is very slow, searches need to be exact. Back orders are being sent to Stolina before they are ready to order or pay for it. These issues are the most important to him at the moment.

## What features are you using on the website that don't involve directly purchasing goods?

Most commonly uses 'Coming soon' and 'back in stock' to figure out what's new and what hot items are available. Often uses the shipping overview page in the 'My Account' page. Also uses 'Download Translastions', *uses the Fast50 texting feature (worth checking to see the total number of dealers who use this feature).* Sometimes checks sales history.

When screen sharing, looking for these pages took forever to load on his account page, has bad internet at his place. Very uncommon, suspects that it's an issue on his end and not ours.

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the home page?

Checks back in stock first, then checks the New Magic list (without going to the list page through `<nav>`).

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the accounts page?

Very useful page, most dependent on the shipping overview and likes how it looks. Really likes the shipping overview page, which looks like this on his end:

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website? 

Not at the moment, the site works just OK. The most important thing for him is that he has a quick overview of what's new, and see what we have in stock and whatever the product information. Works very closely and talks a lot with Chris in sales.
