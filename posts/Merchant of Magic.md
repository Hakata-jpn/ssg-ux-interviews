## Tell me about Merchant of Magic, and what your interactions with the Murphy's Magic Site?

Mostly does work through web services, some aspects of sales are manually to merge with the web services. Is a hybrid model since they are also a brick and mortar. Looks for items to promote, hidden gems that he can get more of in his shop. Sometimes chooses them over presales since they're more under the radar compared to prerelease items. Uses the videos from Murphy's, uses direct video embeds from Murphy's, as well as uploading videos into Vimeo.

Pulling stock manually if it's a preordered, you're checking for new and BiS. Both checking prices and seeing what's good to advertise. Often initial versions of ad copy are terrible and need to be rewritten. All done manually, would really like it if it was proofread before products were allowed to released on the site.

## How proficient with technology are you?

Very comfortable using a computer. 

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic?

Murphy's a great website, UI is good but a few tweaks. Missing a few tweaks and it's good.

## On a scale from 1-10 (with 10 as a perfect score), how would you rate the experience of using the Murphy's Magic website and why?



## What features are you using on the website that don't involve directly purchasing goods?



## What are your first thoughts when you look at the home page?

The boxes are great, I wish I could get a larger copy of the ad images for myself. Because it's an L shape, he can't use this. Easier access to marketing information is critical, but missing here.

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the accounts page?

Got all the data that he needs

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website?

Three things to fix:

1. If a customer cancels an order, then you have to manually change the order with Sales because of the webservices order doesn't allow you to change it once it's been made. Constant struggle, always what he discusses with his reps, who CAN fix it. Wants to handle the error handling himself since it happens so often.

2. Small thing: Most of the demos for products aren't always hosted by Murphy's, wishes for all of the products to be hosted on our end. The majority of the time, when links go down, it's 3rd party sites that stop hosting the videos.

3. Would like to see what is the most popular version of items from all of the dealers, would love to know what's selling. A selection of a small survey with curated questions to determine what's good for them. This could end up paying off for end consumers in the future. None of the categories are compelling because they're so static. *UPSELL OPPORTUNITY* Could we make this flexible so that you could make this a reuseable utility? Ask "what are we trying to achieve"

4. Items for display would be a great list for a brick and mortar, would like more catering for brick and mortars.
