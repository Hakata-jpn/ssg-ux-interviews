## In terms of all of the clientele you've worked with at Shopify, how does our buying experience compare to those sites?



## Wholesale is infamous for out-dated websites with poor formatting, how do we compare from examples that you've seen in your experience with developing for e-commerce? How do we compare to wholesalers in the magic industry and in which ways are we better/worse? (Besides Ellusionist)

Thinks we're difficult compared to them, needlessly sticking to old tech for the sake of doing so. Even others 
Magento would still be good, needs a full time developer to maintain the server. The wholesaler tools from Shopify blow away what we have in his mind. Can do a bunch of tiered promotions and other features without heavily weighing down the site experience in terms of speed and custom code.
Lowered the cost of services from 110,000 via magento to 2000 a month for an enterprise corporation (multichannel and B2B businesses)

Buys from t11, Ellusionist, and us. Theory11 is his favorite wholesaler to deal with, they're using a custom built shopify setup in a way he's never seen it before. "I can order from my phone!"

## In your mind, what are specific areas/functions of the website that need addressing, and what would your suggestions be?

Mobile friendly is massive.
Why are you allowing to allowing people to download SD video? Why is it on a new window?
Shopify CAN be used with wholesale, feels like it's worth looking into platform integration but it'll take work and a long time. They can build to spec but it's hard.
Ai implementations could be way more easily done via Shopify and other, newer e-commerce platforms.

## Are there any features that we could include into our store that you think would massively improve CX?

Headless CMS gives us more front end control, but also gives you more work because you have to build in the implementation yourself.

## Do you have any comments on the process of onboarding users regarding Web Services? How difficult is the implementation? 

Was an ok experience, the developer center was really outdated and the video system required a separate login and powered by flash. API should be rebuilt to be configured for Shopify because it's so integral to the majority of dealers. Has to import products mostly by hand. Should check how old the API is, developers won't touch them if they're older than 10 years old.

One merchant launched 8 years ago, used new tech from the start and currently help their competitors but the systems they're using are so outdated that it's not getting updated anymore. So much is impossible, making things work with Shopify is so difficult that some features are impossible. Called us behind our competition. Thinks that we are absolutely losing money because of our tech because we can't adapt to future settings. Our servers will not be able to be compatible with future technologies in e-commerce and leaves us vulernable to competition.

Our documentation is almost non-existant compared to what they have at Shopify. Some of it is even outdated at this point to the degree of a security risk.

"if you're not terrified to try something but not afraid to die, your priorities are completely backwards"

The new change is to shift towards moving the back end of the site towards other companies and having them manage them. The technology we want them to connect to makes it worse for his customers, so he refuses to integrate when it comes down to potentially letting down his customers. Thinks that the better design of the pages would be a massive boon to sell to customers, and on top of that, the back end would be a critical way to solve UX problems and increase CX
