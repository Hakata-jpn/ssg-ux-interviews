## Tell me about Santa Magic, and what your interactions with the Murphy's Magic Site?

Working Santa Claus full-time, for the last 6 years. Transitioned from home visits to performing magic tricks (speficically the magic color book). We carry their book, and now he develops Christmas related magic for Santas to use and how he got started with Murphy's. Buys a lot of mental bells, but now *carries 2300 products chosen by hand*, ships worldwide, and now manufactures product as well.

Hasn't been able to figure out automation, all of it by hand. Reviews all of the products through his perception and chooses them, has his son add them to the site. **DOES MOST OF HIS WORK ON THE IPHONE 12, does a lot of his searching and cart adding while he's out and about, then confirm purchases at home. Does Fast50 from his phone.**

Insurance is how he actually makes his living, and he uses that to fund his business. This is mostly a side business funded and self-supported by his book.

## When looking for new products to promote, what is your strategy for finding new products to promote and sell?

Product emails are good, it's pretty 50/50 on the selection it sends me. Has a lot of back orders, can take some time to get those in. Check websites on occasion, checks different wholesalers to see what he might like.

## How proficient with technology are you?

Not super proficient, does almost everything by hand or delegates to his son.

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic? What functions on those websites do you find to be the most useful?

Ellusionist's pricing scheme makes it really hard to profit. Would love it if we carried all of their goods. Purchases from us the most, mentioned Max Magic and finds that they're horribly non-responsive. D Robbins is responsive, has good products but hard to navigate. Fun Inc. exists but not very good selection. Magic Makers has a good website but limited inventory.

Feels like it's harder to get what he wants when he conducts business with us on the phone. Feels as though we aren't as responsive as we used to be.

## On a scale from 1-10 (with 10 as a perfect score), how would you rate the experience of using the Murphy's Magic website and why?

Website is great, simple and easy to navigate. Been very happy with the site, would prefer a 50% over 60% pricing scheme.

## What features are you using on the website that don't involve directly purchasing goods?

Spends the majority of his time searching for items on our site, sorts through new products. 

Likes twister for products. Feels like we haven't had a lot of products there, sometimes we don't even have discounted items are on there, it'll be normally priced.

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the home page?

Checks the home page often. Manually purchases things by hand because he likes looking through the products. 

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the accounts page?

Clicks on this page all of the time, likes the purchase ranks to compare to others. Doesn't pay much attention to dealer messages nor does he use Order Status. Doesn't use business tools, likes the 0-5 dollar giveaway items to throw in the boxes he sometimes gives as freebies.

RMA has been the most disappointing, either says he's done too many or it times out/kicks him off the page. The 'File a claim' is missing a video submit option so it's hard for him to demo the product and show how busted it is.

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website? 

Doesn't know how to import or export products from our page, and would like to be more automated in the future. Sometimes orders are made but he can't fulfill them because they're out of stock but he can't update quantities on his site.

Can't stock expensive items as a result since he can't guarantee that he can sell them.
