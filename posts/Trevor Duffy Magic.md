## Tell me about Trevor Duffy Magic, and what your interactions with the Murphy's Magic Site?

Been dealing with Murphy's for 22 years, since 2000. Mainly as a supplier at first, then became a dealer in South Africa. Places orders every two weeks for South African magicians. Very small business, sideline to full-time performance. Does all types of shows, kids tricks to corporate events.

Manually searches products via product code and adds to cart twice a week, all manual process. Doesn't sell at magic shows, could see other magicians in his country doing it but doesn't feel professional.

## When looking for new products to promote, what is your strategy for finding new products to promote and sell?

Sends an email and WhatsApp message to his groups of messages to see what magicians want and then do a group order. Will recommend special goods for every order with a minor discount, mostly lets the guys do their own research though since it is so time consuming. Will use the guys recommendations from time to time and give them advice on it, feels like he has a good barometer. Feels like his customers also know what they want anyways and they trust him with his honesty. Will tell people what is best, even if it loses him money.

## How proficient with technology are you?

Seems well enough to make things work, maybe not a developer but tech savvy enough to not struggle on his end.

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic? What functions on those websites do you find to be the most useful?

Doesn't online shop, it's available in South Africa but it's not very common there. Murphy's doesn't stand out as being bad, would say it's pretty good

## On a scale from 1-10 (with 10 as a perfect score), how would you rate the experience of using the Murphy's Magic website and why?

Thinks the site is excellent, struggles to find something to say about the site.

## What features are you using on the website that don't involve directly purchasing goods?

Doesn't really look through them.

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the home page?

If he's buying on behalf of someone, then he just uses the search bar and lets other people navigate the site on his behalf for products.

Starts at the top, looking at anything that catches his eye. Supposes it's all a matter of design. Won't open a page if it doesn't look like it suits his style which he's curated over decades. It's not always the most obvious thing since he's got a particularly discerning eye.

Moves over to 'New Magic' afterwards, though he doesn't particularly spend a lot of time there since he's not really interested and more specific in his search criteria.

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the accounts page?

Checks for recent orders and order status to see what the shipping cost, sometimes has issues with finding shipping costs. Struggles sometimes to find the actual cost of shipping, closed orders still show estimated shipping instead of actual shipping, which makes it hard to determine how much he needs to charge his customers. **Would like to know where he can find final cost**

Might go find instructions on behalf of a customer who is struggling to get them.

Back orders list is useful too.

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website? 

Supplies Magic Mat in three different sizes, but not in a family and when you look it up it's buried under other less relevant magic items. The way the search is performed is not exactly great at finding items, lots of relevant items get buried under other items.

This also happens with Bicycle playing cards and they get buried so he can't find plain red or blue cards.
