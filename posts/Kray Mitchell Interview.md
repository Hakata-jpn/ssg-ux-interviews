## Tell me about your experiences with UX, and your thoughts on the site experience at Murphy's.

Been a web developer since 97' and consults on behalf of Shopify to set up online stores on the technical side of things. Does a lot of SEO, uses Shopify for his own store, and helps businesses.

## How positively do you find other magic dealers rating our site? Are there complaints you often hear about it?

Doesn't talk with many dealers, mostly just the magicians. They all love the selection that Murphy's likes.

Said the worst in the industry is Ellusionist and likes that he can now get a few things through us. Thinks their new site is bad from a design perspective.

## What are some critical changes you would recommend for us to make to improve our website experience for dealers and site visitors?

- Less images, less text, less scrolling.
**- Video platform doesn't work well with dealer sites outside of Murphy's, will refuse to integrate them into his store until we get it right. It should be immediate, customer buys item, dealer gets charged, and customer can DL right from his site.**
- Thinks redoing old videos for hot products would be a **massive upsell opportunity**
- Thinks we should use a headless CMS (obvs via Shopify)
