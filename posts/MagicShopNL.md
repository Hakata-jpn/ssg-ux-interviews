## Tell me about magicshop.nl, and what your interactions with the Murphy's Magic Site?

Browses daily, checks new products daily. Usually has fixed times to check in the morning and the evening. Restock products, gets an email for items going out of stock in his shop and orders on our site. Hybrid model with a brick and mortar but also automates online orders.

Has an internal system on his site for product notifications. Uses our emails and instagram. Customers often provide him information by asking him about upcoming products.

## How proficient with technology are you?

Advanced... ok maybe not. But I am comfortable. Has programming experience.

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic?

Daily basis, 1-2 orders a day. Likes the Murphy's site, thinks it works perfectly. It's straightforward, and works the way he wants it to. Unlike other sites, we don't have to pay when we order which makes the experience a lot simpler.

## On a scale from 1-10 (with 10 as a perfect score), how would you rate the experience of using the Murphy's Magic website and why?

Really likes the site, said he'd rate it highly.

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the accounts page?

Doesn't use most of the features on this side of the page. Checks invoices and that's about it.

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website? 

Mentioned it to Karl, the items get ordered from backorder, then don't show up as 'ordered'. Possible fix is to just denote items that have already been ordered from backorder in gray.
 
(is this a cart issue? Sounds like it could just be a UI issue)

Wants to sell products on his second site, wishes there was something like shopify for his own case. A 'shopify' for all products we sell for his secondary site. Currently uses something called "Brogan + Wordpress", and it's not very condusive to his web experience.
