## Tell me about Iowa, and what your interactions with the Murphy's Magic Site?

Business is slow. Newer dealer, closing the brick and mortar soon because of the pandemic + local disaster. Working on a transition towards online only with "Ron Hessing"(?). Previously use Quality Magic Sites, they refused to work with PoS systems. Migrated to the Shopify program. Still doing a few conventions a year, second job willing.

Overall? Changing business model.

Everything was done manually for the last while. Bought every product for the store piece by piece. Incredibly tedious, every product was added manually (2000 of them!)

The process is hard sometimes because a customer would want to order again after the orders were processed. Back orders could be done on his end but a headache since it was manual and beaten out by other dealers. Would be too costly otherwise to include a developer to complete automations to solve these problems. They will have a minimal support dev on contract, we give him credits towards hours of development of this site. *Wants to automate orders automatically in the future, maybe not how products are added.*

*Would benefit immensely from the a page where he can download assets for a product for marketing + store page + etc.*

## When looking for new products to promote, what is your strategy for finding new products to promote and sell?

Was super insistent, would test order products before selling them. Intentionally chooses to stand behind the products he sells because he's a smaller player and wants to minimize waste. Uses The Magic Cafe to research products in advance, knows other dealers will do it.

Playing cards sell incredibly well but he still vets products with his wife, works together to find the best products. Buys low quantities. Looks for recent but not brand new products. Wishes he got to know about other products not being released on the GP or presale. Uses brand recognition to identify bad magic from good  (Dislikes Sansminds and likes TCC, will carry more of a superior product).

## How proficient with technology are you?

Not super proficient.

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic? What functions on those websites do you find to be the most useful?

Really likes browsing new products on our site, but likes product suggestions on shopping platforms.

## On a scale from 1-10 (with 10 as a perfect score), how would you rate the experience of using the Murphy's Magic website and why?

9 or 10.

Most of the time it works really well, minus the speed. When it's not overloaded, it's fine. Periods of traffic will often make navigating the site unbearable. *Especially important given that he's doing everything manually*

## Where do you go on the home page? What's your first priority?

Knows the site loads different products every time, will just navigate back from time to time, checks shop all magic. Likes the products he sees, will check back in stock.

Spends minimal time on content curation, checks once a week based on interest and customer demand. Has a second job so his wife runs the store and he puts out fires. Wife likes looking at the content.

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the accounts page?

Working orders, floats between here and Fun Inc. or D Robbins. Sometimes they'll float between wholesalers for alternatives to popular items.

This got changed a while back, I almost never use dealer messages because they were a duplicate of the emails. Uses *Product Instructions Access* all of the time, to address customer service issues. Uses invoices and sales orders often all of the time, doesn't do RMA's. Contacts the sales rep if he has an issue. Has used the FAQ from time to time to refresh his memory. Purchase rank is odd, but he doesn't think it matters.

"Recent orders" changed, now you can't see all of your backorders anymore?? *(Check this out, he can't remember when the change occurred but it's only showing orders from this year, can't see orders from previous years and uses a workaround to find this info)*

Likes the ability to change credit card info.

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website? 

Commented on speed earlier, but doesn't seem to have a lot of complaints since he feels like he's not the most tech savvy. Check 'recent orders' as listed above. Would like to make sure the website is secure, one of our competitors was so insecure, he'd have to get a new card to pay with every time he ordered.
