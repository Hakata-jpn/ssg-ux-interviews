## What is your business?

Sells all types of magic goods, except for downloads which they cannot sell through web services. Sells on demand, and is the sole member of the business.

## How good are you with computers?

Incredibly proficient, set up the website by himself and often catches issues before IT does.

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic?

Every day. He shops a lot of other retailers (Yahoo.jp, Amazon, Rakuten) and finds that in comparison to the experience at Murphy's, they've all got their little quirks and have a learning curve.

## On a scale from 1-10 (with 10 as a perfect score), how would you rate the Murphy's Magic website and why?

A 7-8~. His biggest issue is with *discontinued goods*, since changes to products do not update on his end of his store website. Product information tends to disappear as well.

## What features do you most often use on the website?

- New Tricks
- Open orders
- Payment

Yukari asked about the business tools and it was his first time even noticing that it was there. Doesn't use it because he sells on demand. 

He also noted that searching is getting better.

Yukari also often sends them the tutorial information, he's pretty quick on the presales.

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website? 

- Improvements and easier accesibility to the Discontinued Products section.
- *Would be incredibly interested in an update for downloads to accept purchases in Japanese yen.*
