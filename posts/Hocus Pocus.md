Betty@hocuspocus.com - uses mobile, unbelieveable 

*NOTE: This interview was less linear than the rest, questions are answered out of order, minimized, and additional questions were asked in their place*

## Tell me about Hocus Pocus, and what your interactions with the Murphy's Magic Site?

Product related searching from Max, Paula does more of the billing. Max uses the message center and lives by it.

Checks back in stock, new items, dealer messages. Looks mainly for things that are low quantity, so they can reserve them and hold them. Will buy hot items if they're low in stock if he can swoop all of the units. Might be interesting to show stock that might be coming soon (or later!). Hybrid & Brick and Mortar, so also looking for things to showcase in store but also does automated ordering. Hours and hours a day spent on this website.

## How proficient with technology are you?

Pretty comfortable, don't ask his dad for tech stuff ever. You should ask Betty about mobile.

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic?

Everything is kind of unique so it's hard to compare things. Murphy's is a pretty straightforward website with minimal complications. Any time that isn't the case, he's calling sales and both parties are losing time. Valuable time lost for him since he works retail as well.

## On a scale from 1-10 (with 10 as a perfect score), how would you rate the experience of using the Murphy's Magic website and why?

*7 or 8*

Finds it user friendly, there's a lot of features he hasn't tried yet but thinks it's something *he's* at fault for. Compared to others, this site is very useful and he mostly only has minor complaints. Likes it way more than other magic websites. It's slow 

## What features are you using on the website that don't involve directly purchasing goods?

Already answered above.

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website? 

The website takes waaay longer than any other website he's been on. It's something that they've always brought up with internal staff at Murphy's. Feels like the message center is really good and would be a lot better if access to information was more plain to see. He thinks it's a great source for incoming information and would like to see it better utilized.

Moving items into backorder means they're locked in and can't be removed from the cart.

Wishes he can find all discounted items in a list, and items that have an MAP/are discountable. There's not an easy way to see what items are MAP (you have to click into it to see it unless it's in a family, if it's not in a family, then you have to click on the product page to see the MAP status)

Wouldn't mind seeing more open box videos for products.

There used to be a section for sharing promotional pictures (Michelle may have been in charge of it in the past?), would make promotions easier for dealers.

*Would love it if items were updated on their site every time we update a product on our site.*

## Would you like to see a massive change in the next version of the website? 

Likes how it is now, and doesn't think it's good to change too much. Ellusionist tries too hard to break the mold and it often hurts them, in both website design and product strategy. Depends too hard on tech. You guys want something that works.
