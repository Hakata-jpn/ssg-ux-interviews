## Tell me about TripOnMagic, and what your interactions with the Murphy's Magic Site?
Used to work at Murphy's Magic in 2016, now started his own company in Lincoln. Uses webservices to order goods directly, but also does sales on other platforms through Ebay and such manually and that's why he has so many searches. Does fulfillment, pretty seamless.

Likes the platform more than Amazon's seller platform.


## How proficient with technology are you?

Feels pretty comfortable on a computer.

## How often do you use other shopping websites and how do they compare with Murphy's Magic?

Doesn't shop online very often, even outside of work. Prefers investing.

## On a scale from 1-10 (with 10 as a perfect score), how would you rate the experience of using the Murphy's Magic website  and why?

10. No issues at all. Minor bugs here and there but no real complaints.

__Minor Issue:__ When something is listed as instructions on the product page, send you to the password page but doesn't give you entry to the tutorial (as a dealer). Workarounds for this in the My Accounts.

*fix this by making the tutorial link work differently for logged in users and dealers, with free access to dealers but not end users*

## What features are you using on the website that don't involve directly purchasing goods?

*Doesn't use a lot of the features*

*Doesn't use dealer messages*

__Most Used:__
Accessing Tutorials and Passwords, was really good that this was implemented.
Sales History is really good for finding discounted products.

*Other parts of the site commonly used:*
- All New Magic
- Internal CSP's in the Developer
- Make a Payment
- File a claim (RMA's, but this is less common)

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the home page?

Nothing pops up. Just really familiar with the site and doesn't mentally process it anymore.

All of the 5 keys on the account drop-down.

Dealer Portal: Never used it, could see it as being useful. Interesting at least.

## What are your first thoughts when you look at the accounts page?

Doesn't use a lot of these pages. Code changes/Price/Image/Trailer changes should probably go out in a mailer, too important to leave in a hidden page. I should as a user know when things change since dealers sites don't update with changes for products.

A possibility for making a notification appear for the link to that page when a code changes, with the number of changes listed before you click on it like an iOS app icon.

## What features or improvements would you like to see in the next version of this website? 

Not really, finds the website to be fine.
