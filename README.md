## Why did you do this? Isn't Word or Docs easier?
Yes, I normally take notes by hand but I like markdown more for notetaking and I was informed that writing notes during interviews makes me look less attentive. I also really like SSG's and have been wanting to build one with NextJS for a long time. This solution let me organize my thoughts while also letting me look at the camera for interviews!
