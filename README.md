# UX Interviews on a Static Site Generator (SSG via NextJS)

## How to deploy:
1. Clone this repo
2. Using Terminal, input `cd ssg-ux-interviews`
3. Input `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
4. Input `npm run dev` or the yarn equivalent and open `localhost:3000` on your browser

## Why did you do this? Isn't Word or Docs easier?
Yes, I normally take notes by hand but I like markdown more for digital notetaking and I was informed that writing notes during interviews makes me look less attentive. I also really like SSG's and have been wanting to build one with NextJS for a long time. This solution let me organize my thoughts while also letting me look at the camera (and person I'm talking to) for interviews!
